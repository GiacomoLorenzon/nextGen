Crack The Case
 LocationCopenhagen, Denmark  CategoryProfessional development
Are you ready to leverage your analytical skills and creativity to drive societal change?

 

At BCG, we are dedicated to developing strategic solutions that impact our society and foster tangible improvements. Now, we are handing you the reins.

 

Introducing the latest edition of our Crack the Case competition, an annual case competition dedicated to solving Social Impact challenges.

 

At this case competition, you will have the chance to collaborate in teams of four-five people, tackling a real-world case from an organization committed to societal betterment. The culmination of your hard work will be a presentation of your solutions to a panel of judges on the competition's final day. The winning team will earn the extraordinary chance to share their insights and findings directly with the leadership team and board of the chosen case company.

 

In recognition of exceptional talent, a selected number of participants will be extended offers for a six-week paid internship with BCG Copenhagen. The timing of the potential internship will be accommodated to your studies.

Please note that the case competition is only open to students residing in Denmark.

During the three-day case competition, you will be coached by BCG consultants and provided with BCG tools and techniques to help you solve the case. In between all the hard work, we will have fun getting to know each other through dinners and team activities as well as finish off with a celebratory party on the last day! Crack the Case is a fantastic opportunity to ignite change, broaden your professional circle, and experience the life of a BCG Management Consultant firsthand.

 

Please note that during the three days, you will be staying at Nimb Hotel, and sharing a room with one other student participant from the event. Please note that you are applying as an individual team member, and it is not possible to apply as a team. BCG will create groups based on the selected participants.
